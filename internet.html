      <h1>The Internet.</h1>
      <p>How does the Internet work? What are some daily practices? and how can we implement them into our daily lives?</p>

        <h2>✱What is Encoding?</h2>
        <p>Encoding is the process which creates a secure password for your data, whether that be a photo, text, or payment information. You can be sure to thank the encoding process that your phone number isn't leaked, and your credit cards aren't maxed out! Different formats like ASCII or UTF-8 exist for readability across different systems. Data encoding, such as Base64 or URL encoding, transforms binary or special characters into text suitable for transmission.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <h2>✱What is Encryption?</h2>
        <p>Encryption is the way in which you are converting data into a coded section to prevent unauthorized access. It uses algorithms and special keys to help transform readable data (like a credit card) into an unreadable key. Only individuals or systems with the correct decryption key can convert the encrypted data back to its original format.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <h2>✱How does Data Travel?</h2>
        <p>Data travels across different networks by first being broken into small packets, each containing a little piece of the original information and metadata like sender and receiver addresses. These packets are transmitted through networks using routers and switches following policies like TCP/IP to ensure smooth routing and error handling. If the data is locked, it is unreadable during transmission and is only decrypted at the destination using the correct key.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <h2>✱Secure Communication practices.</h2>
        <p>Secure communication practices are very important for protecting sensitive data from hackers that can easily access and attack. Real world situations include encrypting data both in transit and not to prevent eavesdropping, using multifactor authentication to check user profiles, and implementing strong, unique passwords. Software updates help protect against faults in versions, while using secure networks, such as encrypted WiFi and VPNs, safeguards data on public connections.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <h2>✱HTTPS and Security.</h2>
        <p>HTTPS or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is a process used to help secure communication over the internet by helping encrypt the data between a user's browser and a website. It uses SSL or TLS : Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security,  to create an encrypted connection, preventing someone from intercepting or selling the data during/after transmission. HTTPS makes sure that the data, such as passwords, payment information, or personal details, is encrypted and secure from potential hackers.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <h2>✱Best Practices.</h2>
        <p>When online shopping, sending texts, and sharing information online, it's important to have security and privacy be of upmost concern by following these best practices. Always look for HTTPS in the LINK to make sure that your data is always strongly encrypted, and be sure to enable two-factor authentication for your accounts. Use strong and difficult-to-guess passwords for each site, and use a password manager to keep track of them. Do not use public WiFi for transactions unless you're using a VPN! and be smart against phishing scams by verifying the company/sender of emails and links. Update your browser and software to patch security faults, and use ad blockers and privacy tools to minimize tracking.</p>
